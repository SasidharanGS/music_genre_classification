# music_genre_classification
## Aim:
To Compare and contrast CNN and RNN based music genre classification methods


# Methodology:
- Preprocessing done on the famous GTZAN dataset
- 3 models have been created, 2 for CNN and 1 for RNN
- The selection of activation functions and number of layers have been made following general practices and after some deliberate trial and error
- All the models are trainable on a moderately-powered laptop


# How-to:
- All code is in "Jupyter Notebook" (.ipynb) format
- Run and edit cells with the help of included comments
- The originally computed weights are also provided as seperate files (.h5) to import and use
